# climatewins-weather-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project for predicting the consequences of climate change using weather data from 18 European weather stations. The project includes supervised and unsupervised learning models, data analysis, and ethical considerations for AI in weather prediction.

## Objectives
- **Identify unusual weather patterns in Europe.**
- **Monitor increasing trends in extreme weather.**
- **Forecast future climate conditions (25â€“50 years).**
- **Assess safe regions in Europe.**

## Data
The dataset includes historical weather data from 18 stations in Europe, covering variables such as:
- Temperature
- Wind speed
- Global radiation
- Snowfall

The data ranges from the late 1800s to 2022 and is provided by the **European Climate Assessment & Data Set** project.
