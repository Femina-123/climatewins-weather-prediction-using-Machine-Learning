# climatewins-weather-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project for predicting the consequences of climate change using weather data from 18 European weather stations. The project includes supervised and unsupervised learning models, data analysis, and ethical considerations for AI in weather prediction.

## Objectives
- **Predict extreme weather events** using machine learning models.
- **Identify regional climate trends** and anomalies in weather patterns.
- **Use unsupervised learning** to identify clusters and assess weather patterns over the past 60 years.
- **Incorporate ethical considerations** in AI and machine learning practices, especially concerning biases in predictions.

## Data
The dataset includes historical weather data from 18 stations in Europe, covering variables such as:
- Temperature
- Wind speed
- Global radiation
- Snowfall

The data ranges from the late 1800s to 2022 and is provided by the **European Climate Assessment & Data Set** project.

## Key Hypotheses
1. **If** machine learning is applied to historical weather data, **then** it can predict extreme weather events with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
2. **If** specific weather stations experience regional climate changes, **then** distinct trends can be identified using machine learning models.
3. **If** we analyze weather conditions over time, **then** machine learning can highlight days with dangerous weather conditions (e.g., storms, heat waves).
